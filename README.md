# awesome-resources (inspired by awseome-lists)

An (opinionated) repository containing resources and curricula for self learning on a variety of technical topics that started as a way for me to keep track of the references I use(d) to learn a new topic. When folks have asked me about references/resources to learn specific techniques, topics, and subjects I used to send a whirlwind of ad-hoc links but as it became more common (and the links more unorganized) I decided to: 

1. add some structure to it all and make it more sustainable/lasting and
2. make it public to encourage others to suggest improvements.

These paths/resources are by no means comprehensive or authoritative and are the references that I have found helpful. And there are [many](https://github.com/open-source-society/data-science) [many](https://github.com/memo/ai-resources) [many](https://medium.com/@kcimc/a-return-to-machine-learning-2de3728558eb) other "open curricula" that are more comprehensive and better, this repository strives to provide a "just enough to be dangerous" or "minimum viable knowledge" set of resources to get up and running with a new topic as quickly as possible targets at quick interdisciplinary learning.
