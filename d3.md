## Learning before you Learn (optional but recommended)

Thanks for signing up for the workshop! The workshop will assume some basic familiarity with Javascript and the basics of D3.  And the more background you have coming in, the more you will get out of the workshop.

> Before coming on day 1 you must submit a block: http://bl.ocks.org

### Setup

First things first, bring a laptop and it will be helpful if you have:

- **text editor:** my favorite is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
- **modern web browser:** my favorite is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- **HTTP Web Server:**  
  - Unix/OSX should have one by default (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).
  - If the `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` command doesn't work on Windows, you will need a server like [Mongoose](http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml)

__In [this chapter](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch04.html) from Scott Murray's book, he walks through in more depth the process of setting up your computer.__

### Prerequisites

Also, you'll be better prepared if you have a basic understanding of the technologies (be comfortable with the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript) as well as a basic introduction to D3.

> Am I prepared?

If you can understand Mike Bostock's [Let's Make a Bar Chart](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/) tutorial you will be in a very good place for this workshop.  If not, please review some of the resources below.
