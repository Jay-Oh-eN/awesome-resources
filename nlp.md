# Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing is a interdisciplinary field combining computer science, machine learning and AI, as well as computational linguistics.  NLP is primarily focused on techniques to better represent unstructured text data in a mathematical form as well as models of that text to algorithmically derive meaning.

## word2Vec

> The word2vec tool takes a text corpus as input and produces the word vectors as output. It first constructs a vocabulary from the training text data and then learns vector representation of words. The resulting word vector file can be used as features in many natural language processing and machine learning applications.
