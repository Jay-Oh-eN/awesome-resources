also the videos/slides from this course are quite good: http://ai.berkeley.edu/lecture_videos.html

lecture 16-20 are probably the most relevant

this is a really good resource for a general introduction: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/barbados/jordan-tut.pdf

here is a pretty good book on using graphical model for machine learning: http://www.mbmlbook.com/toc.html

most of Kevin Murphy's stuff is pretty good too: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Papers/intro_gm.pdf

An favorite nostolgic resource of mine is Andrew Moore's slides (maybe a little known fact but before he was the dean he was a top notch teacher :hugging_face:) https://www.autonlab.org/_media/tutorials/bayesnet09.pdf

the intro fro mthe PGM book is a great motivation of PGMs: http://pgm.stanford.edu/intro.pdf
 
and Zico's slides + video are pretty good too (Lectures labeled Probabilistic Programming): https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./15780/#schedule
